Documentation for fcres
=======================

This is the top-level build directory for documenting fcres.  All of the
documentation is written using Sphinx, a Python documentation system built on
top of ReST.  This file has been copied and adapted from matplotlib v1.2
(http://matplotlib.org/), which is licensed as open source
(http://matplotlib.org/users/license.html).  This directory contains:

* make.py - The build script to build the html or latex/PDF docs

* index.rst - The top-level include document for FCSys Utilities

* other .rst files - Placeholders to automatically generate the documentation

* conf.py - The Sphinx configuration

* _static - Used by the Sphinx build system

* _templates - Used by the Sphinx build system

To build the HTML documentation, install Sphinx (1.0 or greater required), type
"python make.py html" in this directory.  The top file of the results will be
./build/html/index.html.
