**Warning!**  This package is still in development.  Some models still have
issues or are incomplete.  These models should be marked with an "under

you have problems besides those noted, please [open an issue]

This package contains models of proton exchange membrane fuel cells in the
[Modelica language](https://www.modelica.org/).  More information is available
in the documentation, which can be accessed through documentation layer of the
Modelica code (starting from package.mo), the help folder (starting from
[FCSys.html](help/FCSys.html)), or online at http://kdavies4.github.com/FCSys.
In particular, see the "Getting started" section of the User's Guide.

There are also optional subpackages ([Test](Test.mo) and [Tests](Tests.mo)) and
to perform tests on the rest of the library.  They are not included in the
documentation and can be safely removed (but may be helpful for debugging).
