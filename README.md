**Warning!**  This package is still in development.  Changes may be made that
affect the public interfaces of the classes.  The package is not yet under full
version control and conversion scripts are not being provided for these
changes.  Some models still have issues or are incomplete.  These models should
be marked with an "under construction" icon (red triangle) or have notes marked
with "TODO" or "**".  If you have problems besides those noted, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/kdavies4/FCSys/issues/new).

[FCSys] contains models of proton exchange membrane fuel cells in
[Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/).  More information is available in the
documentation, which can be accessed through documentation layer of the Modelica
code (starting from [package.mo](package.mo)), the help folder (starting from
[FCSys.html](./help/FCSys.html)), or [online](http://kdavies4.github.com/FCSys).
In particular, see the
[Getting started](http://kdavies4.github.io/FCSys/FCSys_UsersGuide.html#FCSys.UsersGuide.GettingStarted)
section of the
[User's Guide](http://kdavies4.github.com/FCSys/FCSys_UsersGuide.html).

There are also optional subpackages ([Test](Test.mo) and [Tests](Tests.mo)) and
to perform tests on the rest of the library.  They are not included in the
documentation and can be safely removed (but may be helpful for debugging).
