Steps to release the FCSys library:

1/9/13 KD
    1.  Update and run 00-find-quantities.sh to be sure that all quantities are
        used in the code.  Remove the unused ones from resources/quantities.xls
        and update Quantities.mo and resources/scripts/units.mos.
1/3/13 KD
    2.  Update and run 00-find-references.sh to be sure that all references are
        cited in the code.  Remove the unused ones from package.mo
        (FCSys.UsersGuide.References).
1/3/13 KD
    3.  Run spellcheck on the *.mo files using 00-spellcheck.sh.
1/3/13 KD
    4.  Be sure that all of the embedded documentation is up-to-date.  Delete
        the FCSys/help directory and recreate it using Dymola
        (File->Export->HTML).  Then run the 00-make-doc.sh script to apply the
        stylesheet, make special replacements, and update the documentation for
        the website on the gh-pages branch.  Push the gh-pages branch to origin
        (git push origin gh-pages).
1/3/13 KD
    5.  Use http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/ to update the sitemap.  Put it in base
        folder of the the gh-pages branch and push to origin (git push origin
        gh-pages).  Update it in Google Webmaster tools
        (https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/sitemap-list?hl=en&siteUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fkdavies4.github.com%2FFCSys%2F#MAIN_TAB=1&CARD_TAB=-1).
    6.  Address the starred (**) and to do (TODO) items in the code (or as many
        as possible).  Run 00-list-starred.sh and 00-list-TODO.sh to list the
        occurrences of those tags.
    7.  Update the list of checks and tests (tests/checks.mos and
        tests/tests.mos).  Run the checks and tests by uncommenting lines in
        configuration/load.mos and restarting Dymola through that script.
        Address any problems.
1/3/13 KD
    8.  Run 00-autoreplace.py on the code.
    9.  Add an entry to the list of revisions in package.mo.
    10. Commit the revisions to git.
    11. Create a git tag for the release.
    12. Run 00-release.sh.  Browse the result to be sure that the proper files
        are included and that no undesired files are included.  If necessary,
        update .include and .exclude and rerun steps 9-11.
