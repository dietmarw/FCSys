# List of files and folders to exclude when extracting a copy of this folder
# for distribution
#
# This is the order of precedence for determining if a file or folder will be
# included (top priority first):
#   1. The files and folders in .release-include are included.
#   2. The files and folders in .release-exclude (this file) are excluded.
#   3. By default, all files and folders are included.
#
# This is used by rsync via 00-release.sh.
